## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- `notification update --card <id>` flag — reassigns a notification's card by merging a new `payload.card_id` into the existing notification. (#24)

### Fixed

- Integer CLI options are now parsed in base 10 via a shared `parseIntArg` helper instead of passing the global `parseInt` as a Commander coercion. Commander calls coercions as `fn(value, previous)`, so a numeric default became the radix: `dashboard add-card --width 12` (default 6) silently parsed as `parseInt("12", 6) === 8`, and `--height 8` (default 4) became `NaN` → `400 Bad Request: dashcards: [object Object]`. All ~30 integer options now share the helper and reject non-integer input with a clear error. (#23)
- `alert update`, `alert delete`, and `notification update` now work on Metabase v0.59+, which rejects partial `PUT /api/notification/:id` bodies. The CLI now reads the current notification, merges the requested change, and PUTs the full object back with every nested id (handlers, recipients, subscriptions, payload) preserved. Previously the partial body either 400'd (`missing required key` / `invalid dispatch value`) or — because the server diffs nested rows by `:id` and deletes anything missing — silently corrupted the alert into a card-less orphan. (#24)
- `alert update --schedule` no longer wipes the existing Slack/email handler: the cron schedule is carried separately from the handler definition, and handlers are only rebuilt when a channel/recipient flag is passed. (#24)
- `alert delete` archives in place via `active:false` (v0.59+ has no `DELETE /api/notification/:id` route), and a pre-existing corrupt null-payload orphan now fails with a clear, actionable message instead of a cryptic 500. (#24)

### Security

- Resolved all open `npm audit` / Dependabot advisories (dev dependencies only): `esbuild` → 0.28.1 via override (arbitrary file read in the Windows dev server — GHSA-g7r4-m6w7-qqqr, low) and `js-yaml` (quadratic-complexity DoS in merge-key handling — GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68, moderate). `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities. No runtime dependencies changed.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- `question update --db <id>` flag — moves a saved card to a different database. Updates both the top-level `database_id` and `dataset_query.database` so the two never drift. Without this, `PUT /api/card/{id}` with a new `database_id` alone leaves `dataset_query.database` pointing at the old DB and the card keeps running against the original source.
- `alert create` / `notification create`: `--slack-channel <name>` flag for posting to a Slack channel by name. Emits a `notification-recipient/raw-value` recipient with `details.value: "#channel"`, which is the only shape v0.59+ Metabase accepts for channel-name targets.
- `alert create` / `alert update`: `--schedule <cron>` (Quartz/Spring), `--schedule-type hourly|daily|weekly|monthly`, and `--schedule-hour` flags. Schedules are now attached to the top-level `subscriptions[]` as `notification-subscription/cron` (the location v0.59+ expects).
- `notification create`: `--condition rows|has_result|goal_above|goal_below`, `--send-once`, and `--disable-links` flags so the full v0.59+ payload is reachable from the CLI.

### Fixed

- `alert create` / `notification create` with `--channel-type slack` no longer returns `400 Bad Request: {"specific-errors":{"handlers":[{"channel_type":["unknown error, received: :slack"]}]}}`. The CLI now canonicalizes the channel type to the `channel/slack` / `channel/email` form Metabase v0.59+ requires. Both the bare (`slack`) and prefixed (`channel/slack`) forms are accepted.
- `notification create --schedule` no longer attaches a raw cron string to `handlers[].schedule` (which the v0.59+ API silently ignored). The cron is now mounted at the notification level as `subscriptions[{type: "notification-subscription/cron", cron_schedule: "..."}]`, matching the server-side payload model.
- `AlertApi.create` / `AlertApi.update` translate `alert_condition` + `alert_above_goal` → `send_condition` (`has_result` / `goal_above` / `goal_below`) and `alert_first_only` → `send_once`, matching the renamed payload fields in v0.59+. Older callers can keep using the legacy field names; the translation is internal.
- `alert create` now canonicalizes `--channel-type` before validating Slack handlers, so the prefixed form (`channel/slack`) is checked the same as the bare form (`slack`). Previously the prefixed form skipped the guard and could emit a Slack handler with no recipients.
- `alert update --above-goal` without an explicit `--condition` now implies a goal condition instead of falling back to `rows` / `has_result`, which silently downgraded a goal alert.

### Security

- Resolved all open `npm audit` advisories (dev dependencies): `brace-expansion` (ReDoS — GHSA-f886-m6hf-6m8v, GHSA-jxxr-4gwj-5jf2), `postcss` <8.5.10 (XSS in CSS stringify — GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93), and `vitest` 3 → 4.1.8 (critical UI-server arbitrary file read/exec — GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp). `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities. No runtime dependencies changed.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- Global `--verbose` flag (and `METABASE_CLI_VERBOSE=1` env var) to print full API error response bodies. Useful for debugging; off by default.

### Changed

- API errors are now one-line human-readable messages instead of the full server response. Previously a single 500 dumped 5–20 KB of Clojure stacktrace into stdout; now it prints just the top-level `message` / `error` / `cause` field (e.g. `500 Server Error: Invalid parameter: Card 24,009 does not have a template tag named "since_date".`). Use `--verbose` to see the original body. Applies to both HTTP errors and in-band query-execution failures.

### Fixed

- `question update` no longer corrupts v0.59+ cards when template tags are involved. The previous code wrapped `stages[0].native` as an object with nested `template-tags`; Metabase saved the payload but the query processor could not substitute parameters, leaving cards unrunnable ("Card does not have a template tag named X"). Updates now emit `native` as a string with `template-tags` at the stage level, matching native-UI-authored cards. Cards previously corrupted by this bug are healed on their next update.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- `doctor` command: runs 8 diagnostic checks against your Metabase instance (connectivity, version detection, API compatibility)
- `--template-tags` and `--template-tags-file` flags on `question update` (previously only available on `create`)

### Fixed

- `question update --sql` no longer corrupts questions on Metabase v0.59+ — now detects the `stages` format vs legacy `native` format
- Migrated alert commands from deprecated `/api/alert` to `/api/notification` endpoints (backward-compatible CLI interface)
- `segment delete` now uses `PUT` with `archived: true` instead of deprecated `DELETE` endpoint
- `dashboard list` falls back to search API if `/api/dashboard` returns 404 (endpoint deprecated in recent Metabase versions)
- Security: updated transitive deps `vite` (7.3.1 → 7.3.2) and `picomatch` (4.0.3 → 4.0.4), fixing 4 Dependabot alerts

### Changed

- `DatasetQuery` type now includes optional `stages` property for Metabase v0.59+ compatibility
- Alert delete now archives (soft delete) instead of hard delete, matching notification API behavior

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Environment variable authentication: set `METABASE_CLI_AUTH_KEY` and `METABASE_CLI_DOMAIN` to use the CLI without running `profile add` (useful for CI/CD and containers)
- Warning when only one of the two env vars is set
- 5 new tests for env var auth (116 total)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- Dropdown filters rendering as text inputs — `values_query_type: "list"` is now automatically set when using `--source-card` or `values_source_type` in JSON

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- Dashboard filter/parameter commands: `dashboard list-params`, `add-param`, `remove-param`, `map-param`, `unmap-param`
- Bulk filter setup: `dashboard setup-filters --from-json` for configuring all parameters and mappings in a single command
- File input support: `--sql-file`, `--viz-file`, `--template-tags-file`, `--params-file`, `--content-file`, `--definition-file` across `query`, `question`, `snippet`, and `segment` commands
- Shared `resolveInput()` helper with mutual exclusivity validation
- `ParameterMapping` and `ValuesSourceConfig` type interfaces
- 11 new tests (111 total)

### Changed

- CI now runs on `release/*` branches in addition to `main`
- Extracted `serializeDashcard()` helper to reduce duplication in dashboard card commands
- Upgraded `vitest` v2 → v3 (pulls `esbuild` 0.27.4)

### Fixed

- Security: esbuild vulnerability (Dependabot alert #1) resolved by upgrading vitest/vite
